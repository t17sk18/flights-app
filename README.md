## OpenFlights 
### Fligjts review App - Using Ruby on Rails & React

For the first time, using REACT with Ruby on Rails as in the process of constant learning, I have followed the steps and instructions provided by "https://github.com/zayneio/open-flights". 


This app is intended to be a simple example of a CRUD app built with **Ruby on Rails** and **React.js** using **Webpacker**.
